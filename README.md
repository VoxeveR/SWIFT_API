# Swift API

The project involves developing an application to parse, store, and manage SWIFT codes (Bank Identifier Codes, BIC) in a database. The SWIFT codes are being parsed from a provided file, following specific rules, such as identifying headquarters and branches based on the code structure. This application stores this data in a PostgreSQL database. The project is containerized, the endpoints are accessible via localhost:8080.
